                <h2>Igneous</h2>
                <p>
                    Igneous rocks solidify from molten rock (called magma within the Earth and lava on the surface). They are identified by mineral content and texture â€” the size and shape of their mineral grains.
                    Texture is controlled by the rate of cooling: magma that cools slowly deep in the Earth forms rock with large crystals, and lava that cools quickly on the surface forms fine-grained rock.
                    It is composed of the minerals quartz (gray), orthoclase (pink), albite (white), and mica (dark and platy).

                <h2>Sedimentary</h2>
                <p>
                    Sedimentary rocks are layered. Some form when particles of rocks and minerals settle out of water or air. Others form when minerals precipitate directly out of water. Sedimentary rocks are identified by their minerals and texture.
                    As the sediments pile up, water is driven out by the weight of the overlying pile, and minerals precipitate around the sediment particles, cementing them into rock. This process is called lithification.

                <h2>Metamorphic</h2>
                <p>
                    Metamorphic rocks form when sedimentary, igneous, or pre-existing metamorphic rocks are changed by heat, pressure, and chemically reactive waters. These rocks are identified by their minerals and texture.
                    During metamorphism, new minerals grow, with different sizes, shapes, and orientations than those of the original minerals. The chemical composition of the original rock may also change, as some elements are carried away and others are added by the fluids flowing through the rocks.
